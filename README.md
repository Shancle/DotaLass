Dota 2 Stats Retrieval App

- Various stats including Winrate, GPM, XPM.
- List of heroes played and whether a player won or loss
- Fully customizable, choose which stats and where at the click of a button
#### How to Use
- Unzip the release download which can be found [here](https://github.com/heartofimpetus/DotaLass/releases/tag/1.0).
- Run DotaLass.exe
- Either start a match of Dota 2 to automatically download stats for it's players or press the round refresh button to load your last game's data.

#### Is this VAC-Bannable?
No it is not, this app simply takes advantage of a fair to use file called `server_log.txt` in the Dota 2 game directory, aswell as the wonderful [OpenDota](https://www.opendota.com/) public api.
There is no memory reading from the Dota 2 application and risk of being banned.
